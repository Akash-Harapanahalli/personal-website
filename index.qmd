I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the Formal Methods & Autonomous Control of Transportation Systems ([FACTS](https://coogan.ece.gatech.edu/)) Lab at Georgia Tech, under the supervision of Dr. Samuel Coogan, currently pursuing my PhD in Machine Learning and my MS in Mathematics.

My research is centered around safety verification of nonlinear control systems---mainly through reachability and invariance analysis. I have been developing a toolbox called [`immrax`](https://github.com/gtfactslab/immrax), which is an implementation of interval analysis and mixed monotone reachability in JAX. 
Using this toolbox, we have been able to scalably *certify* safe performance of neural networks in safety-critical control systems \[[see here](https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2024.3420968)\], and also *train* neural networks with robust safety guarantees outright \[[see here]()\].

I am also interested in more mathematical tools such as contraction theory and geometric control.
For instance, combining monotone systems theory with geometric integration theory, I developed an algorithm to efficiently compute reachable sets in control systems evolving on Lie groups \[[see here]()\].
