I have been developing a toolbox called immrax, which we have used to scalably certify safe performance of neural networks in safety-critical control systems, and train neural networks with robust safety guarantees outright. I am also interested in more mathematical tools such as contraction theory and differential geometry, and how they factor into modern control systems analysis."

    "text": "[expo] [report] [github]\n\n\nVoxel: A Spinning, 3D LED Persistence of Vision Display\n\nVoxel is a spinning 3D LED display that generates a 360 degree visual in three dimensional space by spinning a panel of densely packed LEDs about a central axis. By spinning at a fast enough rate and rapidly flashing each individually addressable LED on and off, persistence of vision (POV) will take effect. POV is a phenomenon in which a rapid succession of images becomes blended into a persistent, moving image when processed by the human brain [1]. By flashing the LEDs in a specific pattern over time, Voxel will be able to display a smooth, sharp 3D video.\nPersistence of vision has already been exploited in the design of many 2D LED displays. Most monitors use this phenomenon by turning on and off individual rows of LEDs at high frequencies to create the illusion of having the entire display on [2]. More recently, LED ‘fans’ have emerged on the commercial market. These fans have two to four blades lined with LEDs that create smooth 2D images when spun at high enough speeds. These commercial products are generally used for either entertainment or advertising and cost 300 dollars on the low end [3] and upwards of 10,000 dollars on the high end [4].\nInstead of spinning individual lines of LEDs to create a 2D display, the premise of Voxel is to spin a grid of LEDs to create a truly 3D LED display. Three dimensional displays that appear to be holographic would be useful in applications such as home entertainment or commercial advertising. If production of Voxel devices is scaled up to 1,000 a year, the unit cost would be 609.78 dollars. It could be sold at 999 dollars for a profit margin of 61% - making it economically viable to market for home design and commercial advertising uses."

Tilt your head to the side and you can sustain chords. Pinch your thumb and index fingers and wiggle them in the air for some impressive vibrato.

Hiding underneath each key is a button that signals the microcontroller to drive a stepper motor with a specific frequency. The laptop webcam similarly passes a series of values to the microcontroller to add vibrato and chord sustaining features. ### The Software To parse the MIDI files, we used pretty-midi to translate each note and actuation time to frequencies and microseconds. This can directly be fed to the microcontroller, which will run a scheduling algorithm to assign notes to any available stepper motors. For the gesture tracking, we used OpenCV to build a real-time skeleton of your hand and facial structure. Whenever certain gestures are detected, we convert these gestures to floating point values and send them to the microcontroller as a multiplier to adjust shift or sustain a chord."

After a couple hours of debugging, we decided it would not work and had to drive the motor manually. An hour after we gave up, we tried one last-ditch effort with a different approach that actually used less resources than our original proposition. And voila! It worked, drastically reducing the space on our circuit and the number of pins we need to output from the microcontroller.\nAlso, #### Stack overflow was down for a couple hours!!!"

That is why we built Zen, a device that is equal parts complex data-visualization tool and gorgeous art piece. Underneath the calming sandy surface of Zen lies a complex mechanism built from the scrapped parts of a broken 3d printer. A robotic arm magnetically guides a stainless steel marble in the sand to create grooves that can tell you the time, display text, and more. This combination of art with data reminds us that there is always beauty in information: you just need to dig a bit deeper.\n\n\n\nAn onboard microcontroller first chooses what data it wishes to display: say the current time. Using computer vision, we calculate the coordinates that would carve out the numbers in the sand. These coordinates are passed through our custom pathing algorithm to determine a most efficient route, which is then sent to the mechanical assembly. An on-board computer translates the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates to determine which angle and radius values to move the magnetic arm. As the arm traces its path under the surface of the table, the magnetic ball slowly imprints out the number in the sand, giving us a dynamic and physical means to visualize data.\n\n\n\nTo view the plotting process in real time, follow the Colab notebook here. The project broke down into software focused on the plotting algorithm and hardware focusing on the mechanism of the magnetic arm. The software team used the opencv library to skeletonize the paths of a single-stroke font family. This allowed us to select the coordinates of the image that should be part of the letter/number and put them into our algorithm that will trace an optimal path through those points whilst removing outliers at the same time. This trace information can therefore be used to plot any set of letter and numbers, as long as they fit within the dimensions of the display.\nThe hardware side involved iterating over several designs until we settled on the current radially pointed magnetic arm. A lot of soldering, CADing, sawing, lasering, and drilling eventually gave us the semi-transparent design for Zen.\n\n\n\nOn the hardware side, we ran into several issues, the biggest being that the tolerances from our 3d prints were too tight, leading to our entire assembly being unable to spin freely around the center. But with a little ingenuity (and a little hammering), we managed to salvage the situation without having to cut, break, sand, or print any new parts. On the software side, we were dealing with an unfamiliar library and for some, a completely new language, so we first had to climb a learning curve to come out on the other end successful.\n\n\n\nWith this being the third hackathon we have completed together as team Big Fishies, we have noticed a significant increase in both our design quality and aesthetics. The overall look of the device and it’s capabilities has demonstrated our collective growth as a team of engineers and a group of friends.\n\n\n\nWe came into this project idea unsure about whether we would be able to complete this goliath task over the course of the short 36 hours we were allotted. Learning new languages, new skills, and new techniques in such a short amount of time is never an easy task, but creating Zen has been the challenge that has proven there are no limits to the things we can accomplish.\n\n\n\nWe have more plans for what sort of information we can display on our 550 square inch sand display. Using complex apis, we can display stock charts in real time, or even communicate wirelessly with a drawing application to allow users to draw their own paths in the sand.
